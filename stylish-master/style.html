<h3>Introduction to Astronomy</h3>
    <p>While I took this class to fulfill my Area 4 course requirement, I was able to expand on a subject that my major doesn't delve into at all, which includes outer space and the laws of physics. This course taught Kepler's Laws and the effects of gravity on planets, black holes, and stars alike, among so many other topics. Regardless, it was always well-paced and easy to follow, so I felt that I truly learned something about an area that I had never really touched before. </p>

<h3>Introduction to Sociology</h3>
    <p>This course was broken into four different areas of sociological study, which were religion, class and race, family dynamics, and crime, and ultimately analyzied situations in all of them through a lens I had never used before. The course taught the different types of framework in sociology, and how different uses of these frames can basically deduce human behavior.  </p>

<h3>Principles of Economics</h3>
    <p>This course was my favorite class. Going hand-in-hand with Sociology, this course was also able to deduce human behavior within the cyclical nature of an economy, demonstrating how supply and demand are affected by certain societal actions, and how changes in supply and demand lead to certain outcomes. We also studied different market and government types, and how buying and spending fluxuate depending on level of intervention. I felt that I learned scuh useful information in this class, especially for my Finance Major. </p>
		
<h3>Calc with Matrices</h3>
    <p>Business majors take this class in order to practice using Microsoft Excel as a tool when calculating for subjects like profit or interest. This was especially beneficial as I was taking Economics, because all the calculations I learned in theory were the same equations I was learning and practicing in Calc, like Marginal Demand and derivatives for Price and Quantity. </p>
        
<h3>Survey of Finance and Careers</h3>
    <p>In this class, Finance Majors are introduced to their potential career paths and areas of study under the Finance umbrella. On top of that, we are also introduced to all the resources available to those seeking jobs or internships at Virginia Tech.</p>
